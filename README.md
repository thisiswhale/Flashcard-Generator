# Flashcard-Generator

## Overview
A basic backend flashcard application with popular movie themed questions.

The backend will essentially constitute an API that allows users to create two types of flashcards.

1. **Basic** flashcards, which have a front (_"Who was the first president of the United States?"_), and a back (_"George Washington"_).

2. **Cloze-Deleted** flashcards, which present _partial_ text (_"... was the first president of the United States."_), and the full text when the user requests it (_"George Washington was the first president of the United States."_)
